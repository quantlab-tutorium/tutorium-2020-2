# QuantLab tools and technology tutorium.

This project contains exercises to be worked on during the quantlab tutorium. They are checked
by running the tests in src/test/main. While you are working on the exercises, you can of course
include a main method.


## 11/09 Review

We start off with a review of how to get started and run your code from the IDE, from a main method or as a JUnit test.
Further we take a look at the finmath library and maybe the main take-away of the preceding lecture.

For the exercise itself, you are given an incomplete class, named DerivativePricing, which evaluates calls and puts in the Black-Scholes model via Monte-Carlo simulation. As well as a skeleton PutOption class. Your job is to complete these and run DerivativePricing and DerivativePricingTest.
